# Colora
Java Android application for the color lovers!

My very first programming project which was created so long time ago that is not supported on the current android devices.
Still had unfinished ideas and branches (such as picking a color with your phone camera or gallery), but the main functionality worked at it best!

Installing it on your Android device (target API Android 7, API level 24), you could:  
• Pick a color using sliders or entering the HEX code  
• Switch between CMYK and RGB sliders  
• Save colors and give them a name.
